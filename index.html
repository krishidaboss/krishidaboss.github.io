<h4 style="color: gold"> Clash Royale is a game created by Supercell. They created the really famous game Clash of Clans. In Clash Royale you have cards and use them in battle. 
The cards come to life and fight your opponent. Clash Royale is a real time game where you battle opponents who are real people. 
It's a great game which is fast paced and needs a lot of strategy. It's much more strategic than you'd expect. My personal favorite card is the Prince. But that's my opinion. 
Over the next few days I'll teach you how to become a master of Clash Royale. I'll teach you strategies and famous decks. You'll be a master in no time. 
First I'll teach you an attack which my friend calls the Destructive Push. This attack must be done in in overtime. Save for 10 elixir. The cards required are Balloon, Giant, and Musketeer.
It would work better with Valkrie too, but that's not needed. First place down the Giant and the Balloon. Then to support them put down a Musketeer. Then when you have enough elixir put down a Valkrie 
or any othe troop that does area damage. Then just spam troops until you get the crown tower. Then you win the battle because in overtime if you get one crown you win. 
Next up I'll tell you mistakes you should never do. First mistake is an all epic deck. When you first start the game you think epics are hella good or something.
But all epic decks involve high-cost cards which involve no strategy. So never make an all epic deck.
